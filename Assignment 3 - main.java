				+ "\nused to teach concepts of computer science (CS). We developed learning materials for middle-school students that "
				+ "\nwere designed according to the constructionist philosophy of Scratch and evaluated them in a few schools"
				+ "\n during two years. Tests were constructed based upon a novel combination of the revised Bloom taxonomy and the Structure of "
				+ "\nthe Observed Learning Outcome taxonomy. These instruments were augmented with qualitative tools, such as observations and interviews. "
				+ "\nThe results showed that students could successfully learn important concepts of CS, although there were problems with some concepts such as"
				+ "\nrepeated execution, variables, and concurrency. We believe that these problems can be overcome by modifications to the teaching process that we suggest.\r\n"

	    		+ "\nThe main theoretical contribution is a novel quadratic transform technique for tackling the multiple-ratio concave-convex FP problem-in contrast to conventional FP "
	    		+ "\ntechniques that mostly can only deal with the single-ratio or the max-min-ratio case. Multiple-ratio FP problems are important for the optimization of communication networks,"
	    		+ "\nbecause system-level design often involves multiple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio terms. This paper considers the applications of FP to solving continuous "
	    		+ "\nproblems in communication system design, particularly for power control, beamforming, and energy efficiency maximization. These application cases illustrate that the"
	    		+ "\nproposed quadratic transform can greatly facilitate the optimization involving ratios by recasting the original nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex problems. "
	    		+ "\nThis FP-based problem reformulation gives rise to an efficient iterative optimization algorithm with provable convergence to a stationary point. "
	    		+ "\nThe paper further demonstrates close connections between the proposed FP approach and other well-known algorithms in the literature, such as the fixed-point iteration and "
	    		+ "\nthe weighted minimum mean-square-error beamforming. The optimization of discrete problems is discussed in Part II of this paper.\r\n"
